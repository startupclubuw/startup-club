## 💡 Code Style

- All custom class names, id names, and custom attribute names in our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript use **camelCase** (for example: `headerContent`, `teamMember`, `navContainer`, `mobileMenuIcon`, `modalAkshith`, `whatWeDo`).
- This applies to all new code and refactored code, including meta tag content values where appropriate.
- This follows industry standards and keeps our code clean, readable, and easy to maintain.
- Please follow this convention for all future contributions.
